## Mansion Men Fantasy Football League

This project is a site I built for a long-running fantasy football league that I am a member of. The goals in building it were threefold.
* First, gain additional practice building a react SPA, with this one being my first that was bootstrapped with Create React App.
* Second, to get my feet wet with Data Visualization, after some searching I found Victory which made it incredibly easy and intuitive to get up and running.
* Finally, I wanted to spend some time polishing my CSS, especially in regards to Flexbox and mobile responsiveness.

I may, in the future, make this a template, that can be more easily adapted to other leagues, but with ESPN lacking a public API that is a bit difficult. I didn't go the web-scraper route, partly because I had already pulled the data before I thought of that, but also because our league doesn't follow standard ESPN playoff structure so some manual data corrections were require. Also, some of the data is specific to my league's setup, although that could be scrubbed out for a template.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
